## Exploring Out-of-the-Box Data and AI Tools for Finance

### A Journey into the Possibilities and Limitations of Making Easy Money with AI in Finance
Welcome to the exploratory landscape of finance! In recent years, there has been a surge in the use of data and artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the finance industry. However, the question of whether it is possible to make money with out-of-the-box data and AI tools is a complex one. On one hand, there are massive amounts of freely available data and good AI models. On the other hand, since it is an easy-to-do analysis, many people are tapping into the same well, leading to scarce resources for each one.

In this exploratory landscape, we will delve into the current state of out-of-the-box data and AI tools in finance, exploring the benefits and challenges of using these tools to make money. We will be using the sklearn and keras libraries for AI tools, and yfinance and brfinance for data gathering. Additionally, we will be using pandas_ta for feature engineering.

So, buckle up, and let's explore the possibilities and limitations of making money with out-of-the-box data and AI tools in finance!
